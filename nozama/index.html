				<br>
				<span class="time">Clinic Thursday, 10.16</span>
				<br><br>
				Using techniques learnt in sessions Risk Identification and Cheap Experiments,
				develop your experimentation plan. Your <mark>experiment plan should include a sequence of
				experiments and details of the experiment design</mark>. You do not need to submit this, but
				hold on to it as this will be a key input for subsequent classes. <mark>You may be asked to
				present this in the next clinic.</mark>

				<span class="deliverable">BONUS Deliverable</span>
				<br>
				<span class="time">Due by Sprint II 10.18</span>
				<br><br>
				Use any tool that you have learnt in your non-studio courses to provide a detailed analysis
				of your solution approach. The analysis should argue for why your solution will be value
				creating. For ex. You may build a simulation to study and estimate the performance of your
				solution. You may obtain and analyze public data to test key hypotheses rigorously.  
				<br><br>
				Bonus points will be awarded for using state of the art analysis tools that you have learnt
				in any non-studio class at Cornell-Tech. Please highlight clearly the tool you have used with
				appropriate references. This can be submitted individually, as the HMW-project team or even as
				a new group you build with individuals from your program. Of course, bonus points will accrue
				only to the entity that submit the analyses. Group submissions will be more fun and are
				encouraged.
				<br><br>
				Note that work on the bonus deliverable should in no way detract from your work on the HMW
				challenge. This is additional optional work and doing this does not reduce your
				responsibilities to your team in any way. [No Strict Due date-- Complete it before Sprint 2
				to best use the analysis in building your solution, but submissions at any point before the
				final presentation will be considered equally]
