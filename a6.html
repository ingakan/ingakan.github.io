	THE KISS.
	<br>

	<p class="description">
	Klimt depicts the couple <span style="color: tomato">locked</span> in <span style="color: tomato">intimacy,</span> while the rest of the painting <span style="color: tomato">dissolves</span> into <span style="color: tomato">shimmering</span>, extravagant flat pattern. The patterning suggests the style of Art Nouveau and the <span style="color: tomato">organic</span> forms of the Arts and Crafts movement. At the same time the background evokes the conflict between two- and three-dimensionality intrinsic to the work of Degas and other modernists. Paintings such as The <span style="color: tomato">Kiss</span> were <span style="color: tomato">visual</span> manifestations of fin-de-siecle <span style="color: tomato">spirit</span> because they capture a decadence conveyed by opulent and <span style="color: tomato">sensuous</span> images. The use of <span style="color: tomato">gold</span> leaf recalls medieval "gold-ground" paintings and <span style="color: tomato">illuminated</span> manuscripts, and earlier mosaics, and the spiral patterns in the clothes recall Bronze Age art and the decorative <span style="color: tomato">tendrils</span> seen in Western art since before classical times.
	<br>
	<br>
	The man's head ends very close to the top of the canvas, a departure from traditional Western canons that <span style="color: tomato">reflects</span> the influence of Japanese prints, as does the very simplified composition. The two figures are situated at the edge of a patch of flowery meadow. The man wears a robe with black and white rectangles irregularly placed on gold leaf decorated with spirals. He wears <span style="color: tomato">a crown</span> of vines while the woman is shown in a tight-fitting dress with flower-like round or oval motifs on a background of parallel wavy lines. Her hair is <span style="color: tomato">sprinkled</span> with flowers and is worn in a fashionable upsweep; it forms a halo-like circle that <span style="color: tomato">highlights</span> her face, and is continued under her chin by what seems to be a necklace of <span style="color: tomato">flowers</span>. Similarly juxtaposed couples appear in both Klimt’s Beethoven Frieze and Stoclet Frieze.

	<br>
	It is thought that Klimt and his companion Emilie Flöge modeled for the work but there is no evidence or record to prove this. Others suggest the female was the model known as 'Red Hilda'; she bears strong resemblance to the model in his Woman with feather boa, Goldfish and Danaë. Klimt's use <span style="color: tomato">of gold</span> was inspired by a trip he had made to Italy in 1903. When he visited Ravenna he saw the Byzantine mosaics in the Church of San Vitale. For Klimt the flatness of the mosaics and their lack of perspective and depth only enhanced their <span style="color: tomato">golden brilliance,</span> and he started to make <span style="color: tomato">unprecedented</span> use of <span style="color: tomato">gold</span> and silver leaf in his own work.
	<br>
	<br>
	It has also been argued that in this picture Klimt represented the moment Apollo <span style="color: tomato">kisses</span> Daphne, following the metamorphosis of Ovid narrative.</p>
